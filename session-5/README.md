## 1. Accuracy so far and how to improve it

So far, we have managed to get our accuracy in the 90% range without adding more samples. But can we even do better :)

We found that applying transfer learning and using a pre-trained model improved our accuracy quite a bit. Can we do more? What if we used two or five models to extract the features? Would it make it better?!

Let's try it

## 2. Using multiple models architecture

How can we use multiple models to extract the features? And how to use all these features to train our small, dense model. The following diagram shows the general flow.

</p>

Here is an example of loading and extracting features from 2 models then combining them  

- Loading the first model 

~~~~{.python}
FEATURE_EXTRACTOR1 = xception.Xception(weights='imagenet',include_top=False,input_shape=targetSize_withdepth)
model1 = Sequential()
model1.add(FEATURE_EXTRACTOR1)
model1.add(Flatten())
~~~~

Notice that we added a Flatten layer to the end of the feature extractor model to make the output a vector.

- Loading the second model 

~~~~{.python}
FEATURE_EXTRACTOR2 = resnet_v2.ResNet152V2(weights='imagenet',include_top=False,input_shape=targetSize_withdepth)
model2 = Sequential()
model2.add(FEATURE_EXTRACTOR2)
model2.add(Flatten())
~~~~

- Extracting first features set

~~~~{.python}
features_x1 = model1.predict_generator(train_generator)
~~~~

- Extracting second feature set

~~~~{.python}
features_x2 = model2.predict_generator(train_generator)
~~~~

- Combining all features into one feature vector

~~~~{.python}
all_features = np.concatenate((features_x1,features_x2), axis=1)
~~~~

The rest will be the same as in session four, but we will use the all_features vector as our training sample. 

Then, let's try to re-train our model and run the tests; what do you find?

This [Notebook](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/blob/master/session-5/Session_5_ensemble.ipynb) has the complete code.

In my tests, Accuracy went up to 99%

## Congratulations 

If you have been following along with the five sessions, Congratulations. We covered so much; we built a simple linear model, approximated non-linear functions, built a system for recognizing chart types from an image, and improved its accuracy till we reached 97%. Learned what Convolution neural network, Training set data augmentation, Transfer learning and Machine Learning model ensemble you should be proud :)

## 3. Assignment

Can you try different model combinations to produce better results?Â
